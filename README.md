This project retrieves news articles based on your specified interest, date range, and language using the News API. It then formats the results as a string with titles and URLs, suitable for further processing or display.

**## Functionality**

* **Fetches news articles:** Leverages the News API to retrieve relevant articles based on user-defined criteria.
* **Customizable:** Allows specifying the topic of interest, date range, and language for the news feed.
* **Formatted output:** Returns the news articles as a string with titles and URLs, ready for integration.

**## Installation**

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x with `requests` and `pprint` libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pprint
   ```

**## Usage**

1. **Create a NewsFeed Object:**
   ```python
   from news_feed import NewsFeed

   # Example usage
   news_feed = NewsFeed(interest="nasa", from_date="2022-12-31", to_date="2023-01-13")
   ```

2. **Get News Articles:**
   ```python
   articles = news_feed.get()
   print(articles)
   ```

   This will print the fetched headlines and URLs as a formatted string.

**## Code Breakdown**

**1. `NewsFeed` Class:**

   - Represents a news feed based on user-provided interest, date range, and language.
   - Stores base URL, API key, and user input as attributes.
   - Provides methods to:
     - `get()`: Retrieves news articles and formats them as a string.
     - `_get_articles(self, url)`: Makes a request to the News API and parses the JSON response.
     - `_build_url(self)`: Constructs the complete URL based on user-provided criteria and API key.

**2. Main Script (`if __name__ == "__main__":` block):**

   - Demonstrates how to use the `NewsFeed` class.
   - Creates an instance with specific interest, date range, and language.
   - Calls the `get()` method to retrieve and format news articles.
   - Prints the formatted news feed string.

**## Important Note**

**- **API Key:**  The provided `API_KEY` in the original code is removed for security reasons. Please obtain your own API key from News API ([https://newsapi.org/](https://newsapi.org/)).**

**## Enhancements**

* **Error handling:** Consider adding checks for API request errors, invalid dates, etc.
* **Output customization:** Allow customizing the format of the returned string (e.g., HTML for web display).
* **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms to avoid redundant API calls for frequent queries.
* **Alternative formatting:** Explore returning the articles as a list of dictionaries for further manipulation.

**## Conclusion**

This project provides a starting point for building news feed applications using the News API. By incorporating the suggestions above, you can tailor it to your specific requirements and create a robust news feed solution.
